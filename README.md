<h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Dealing with Object oriented programming and Test Driven Development this has taught me a lot!!</p>

  <ul>
    <li>First ive installed inquire/jest/etc.</li>
    <li>Then i've made Employee,Engineer,Intern,Manager class functions</li>
    <li>Then I've ran tests and failed then hard coded to pass each test.</li>
    <li>Once all tests have passed, I've then used inquire to make a questionare and add employees to array of object</li>
    <li>Once the questionare is done it writes to and HTML file using a template literal.</li>
    <li>Making sure to import and export what is needed across the files is very important.</li>
    <li>This was a challenging project for me however I've learned a lot!</li>
  </ul>
